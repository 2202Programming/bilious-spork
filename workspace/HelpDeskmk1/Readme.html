  <h2>Homework Assignment #3 : Help Desk, Help Thyself</h2>
</div>

<div>Due: Wednesday, September 17th, Noon CDT<br /> Submit: Turn in
your HelpDesk.java source file (and any other helper Java source files
you devise) using the <tt>turnin</tt> command
on <tt>morbius.mscs.mu.edu</tt>.<br />

Do <b>not</b> turnin the <tt>HelpDeskRunner</tt> class, or any of
the <a href="http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~brylow/cosc2100/Fall2014/Demos/StackDemo/">Stack
Demonstration Code</a>.  These files will be ignored by TA-bot.<br />

Work may be completed in teams of two.<br />

Be certain to include both partner's names in your file.  Try to avoid
both partners submitting code -- we have to grade that twice, and only the
lower grade will be kept.<br />

You may submit multiple times, but only the last turnin will be
kept. The automatic submission system will not accept work after the
deadline.</div>

<div style="text-align: center; background-color: #336600; color: white;">
<h3>Stacks</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p> This assignment uses several <i>Stacks</i> to simulate a HelpDesk for
computer science students.  Use the <a href="http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~brylow/cosc2100/Fall2014/Demos/StackDemo/">Stack Demonstration Code</a> from class
to implement your solution.</p>

<p> The <tt>DSLinkedStack</tt> class bears close resemblance to the
Stack classes in Chapter 3 of your textbook, and has the following
API:</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>void push(T element)</tt><br />
    Adds a fresh element onto the Stack.</li>

<li><tt>void pop() throws StackUnderflowException</tt><br />
    Removes the top element from the Stack.</li>

<li><tt>T top() throws StackUnderflowException</tt><br />
    Returns the top element from the Stack without removing it.</li>

<li><tt>boolean isEmpty()</tt><br />
    Checks whether the Stack is empty.</li>
</ul>

<p> Note that this is a <i>generic</i> Java data structure, and can be
instantiated with any Java class in place of type "<tt>T</tt>".</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: center; background-color: #336600; color: white;">
  <h3>Help Desk Simulation</h3>
</div>

<div>

<p> Your task is to simulate a Help Desk for computer science students
seeking assistance with their homework.  This rudimentary Help Desk will
only be able to help one student at a time, although others may sit in a
nearby stack of chairs while they wait.</p>

<p> Because the Help Desk is aimed primarily at helping students in the
introductory classes, a draconian priority policy has been set in place:
If a student arrives at the help desk from a lower numbered course than
the student who is currently being helped, the current student will be
moved to the stack of waiting chairs until the new student has been helped.
If a student arrives from a higher (or equal) course than the student currently
being helped, the new student will be turned away.</p>

<p> The HelpDesk tutor also keeps track of who is coming and going, using a
pile of notecards.  When the shift is over, the notecards are read back and
logged in reverse order.</p>

<p> Your <tt>HelpDesk</tt> class will be tested for the following API:
</p>

<ul>
<li><tt>public void step()</tt><br />
    Advance the simulation one minute.</li>

<li><tt>public void addStudent(String name, int course, int
    workload)</tt><br /> Add an arriving student with the indicate
    name, course number, and minutes of workload.  If the current
    student has a lower or equal course number, the arriving student
    is turned away.  If the current student has a higher course
    number, the current student is preempted while the new student is
    helped.</li>

<li><tt>public int getTime()</tt><br />
    Get the current simulation time in minutes.</li>

<li><tt>public String toString()</tt><br />
    Return the status of the simulation.  This produces strings like, "<tt>Time 2,	Helping	Jack	from COSC1010</tt>", or  "<tt>Time 9,	IDLE</tt>".</li>
<li><tt>public String getLog()</tt><br />
  Return the entire HelpDesk session log.
  </li>
</ul>

</div>

<div style="text-align: center; background-color: #336600; color: white;">
  <h3>Input</h3>
</div>

<div>

<p> Input to the <tt>HelpDesk</tt> simulator will consist of an initial line
with a number of minutes for the simulation to run.</p>

<p> Each subsequent line of input will consist of an arrival time (in
minutes), a name, a course number (we assume all courses are COSC, and
therefore the letter code is not included,) and a workload time in
minutes.  If only students arrived at the Help Desk in the real world
labeled with precisely how many minutes it would take to help them...</p>

<p> Input arrival times will occur strictly in order -- so each student's
arrival will be strictly greater than or equal to the previous student's.
You may assume that workload times will be strictly positive, non-zero
integers.</p>

<p> Here are some example inputs and outputs.</p>
